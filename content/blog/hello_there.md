It's funny how things can change within the span of a month. 

I've decided to move in a total different course in how I showcase myself as a software developer on the internet. Today, I'm relaunching brycemcwhirter.com and I'm officially launching techportfolio.brycemcwhirter.com. 

My main website will serve as a landing page for sharing projects that I'm currently working on. 

My tech portfolio will be utilized to share my experience as a software developer. I'll share my professional experience in the industry, new technologies that I'm experimenting with, and highlight developer projects that I've worked on.
