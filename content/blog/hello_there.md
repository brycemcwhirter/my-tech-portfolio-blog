It’s funny how things can change in just a month.

I’ve decided to take a completely different direction in how I showcase myself as a software developer online. Today, I’m relaunching brycemcwhirter.com and officially launching techportfolio.brycemcwhirter.com.

My main website will serve as a landing page to share the projects I’m currently working on.

My tech portfolio will be used to highlight my experience as a software developer. I’ll share my professional background in the industry, discuss new technologies I’m experimenting with, and showcase developer projects I’ve completed.
