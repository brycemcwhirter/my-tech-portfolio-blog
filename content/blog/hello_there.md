It's funny how things can change within the span of a month. 

I've decided to move in a different direction in terms of showcasing myself on the internet. This website that you are currently on is a space dedicated to my technical side. Here, you can learn more about my experience as a software developer; the places I've worked, the projects I'm working on, helpful information that I've found useful, all things software development in my livelihood. 

My portfolio, brycemcwhirter.com, will be used as a space to showcase projects that I am maintaining such as this technical portfolio and other projects. This space will hold all projects that I've worked on and serve as a digital footprint of my technical experience. 

I think this is going to be a great change in the long run. Welcome to my tech portfolio and I'm glad you're here!
